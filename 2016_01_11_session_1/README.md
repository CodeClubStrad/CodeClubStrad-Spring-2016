# Session 1
In which we:
 * Unpack a set of Raspberry Pi Model 2Bs

 * Run Minecraft: Pi Edition
 * Use Python to do some basic Minecraft remote control using the excellent [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) learning resource [GETTING STARTED WITH MINECRAFT PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/) and Craig Richardson's fantastic [recipe cards](https://arghbox.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/minecraft-pi-recipe-cards/)
