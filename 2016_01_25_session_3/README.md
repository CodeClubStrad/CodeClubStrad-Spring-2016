# Session 3
In which we will:
 * develop some defenses to keep other players out of our world
 # devleop some traps so if they do come into our world, we will do stuff to them

Remembering that:
 * we need to comment our code!
 * joining other people's worlds & trashing them is fun for us but not for them
 * running clever block generation/trashing code can really slow your (or someone else's) Pi - and even make Minecraft crash
 * memory is a scarce resource which needs to be carefully managed
 * if all else fails pull out the ethernet cable!
