# Session 5: Introduction to SonicPi
In which we attempt to use [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) to make some melodius (or malodorous?) music:
 * [playAllNotes](playAllNotes.rb) - A simple SonicPi 'for' loop used to play a sequence of increasing midi notes
 * [playAllNotesLiveLoop](playAllNotesLiveLoop.rb) - A simple SonicPi 'live_loop' used to play a sequence of increasing midi notes

## Things to try
 * [Appendix A](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/tree/master/etc/doc/tutorial/en) (MagPi articles) to the SonicPi v2.9 Tutorial
 * The SonicPi Examples
