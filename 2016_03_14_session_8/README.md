# Session 8: Using SonicPi to create block wals and towers in MinecraftPi

This time we used SonicPi's live_loop function to build walls and towers whose x & z co-ordinates were defined by the player's position and whose height (y) was defined by the note we chose to play.

For some more sophisticated examples refer to Sam Aaron's [MagPi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/master/etc/doc/tutorial/en/A.06-minecraft.md) code.
