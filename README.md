# Code Club Sessions
Contains all code week by week for the [Stradbroke High School](http://www.stradbrokehigh.co.uk/) Code Club. We'll be using Raspberry Pis to do all sorts of fun things including:
 * Programming [Minecraft](http://pi.minecraft.net/) with [Python](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html)
 * Programmable music with [SonicPi](http://sonic-pi.net/)

We'll be making a lot of use of:
* Craig Richardson's [brilliant book](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/learning-python-using-codecademy/)
* some very useful [FlashCards](http://blog.whaleygeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/minecraftPi-flashcards.pdf)
* and the excellent [Adventures in Minecraft](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/adventures-in-minecraft.html)

If you want to buy your own Raspberry Pi (and all sorts of other extra bits) you can try:
 * [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/)
 * [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/raspberry-pi)

Don't forget you will need a monitor/TV with an HDMI socket.

If 'coding' is not enough of a reason then remember that the RPi will run a version of [LibreOffice](http://www.raspberryconnect.com/officesoftware/item/125-libreoffice-raspberry-pi) (a close relative of OpenOffice) so you can do 'ordinary' homework too :-)

And in case you hadn't noticed, the national [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) organisation is now [part of](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/putting-a-code-club-in-every-community/) the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org).
