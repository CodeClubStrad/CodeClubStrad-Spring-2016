Contains all code week by week for the Stradbroke High School Code Club. We'll be using Raspberry Pis to do all sorts of fun things including
 * Programming [Minecraft](http://pi.minecraft.net/) with [Python](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html)
 * Programmable music with [SonicPi](http://sonic-pi.net/)

And in case you hadn't noticed [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) are now [one and the same](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/putting-a-code-club-in-every-community/) :-)
