# Code Club Strad: Spring 2016
Contains all code week by week for the [Stradbroke High School](http://www.stradbrokehigh.co.uk/) Code Club during the spring term 2016. We'll be using Raspberry Pis to do all sorts of fun things including:
 * Programming [Minecraft](http://pi.minecraft.net/) with [Python](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html)
 * Programmable music with [SonicPi](http://sonic-pi.net/)

For Minecraft Pi we'll be making a lot of use of:
* Craig Richardson's brilliant [learning python with Minecraft Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/learning-python-using-codecademy/) book;
* some very useful [FlashCards](http://blog.whaleygeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/minecraftPi-flashcards.pdf) from [@whaleygeek](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek)
* and the excellent [Adventures in Minecraft](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/adventures-in-minecraft.html) from [@whaleygeek](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek) and [@martinohanlon](https://twitter.com/martinohanlon)

For SonicPi we'll be trying out:

If you want to buy your own Raspberry Pi (and all sorts of other extra bits) you can try:
 * [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/)
 * [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/raspberry-pi)
 * and don't forget you will need a monitor/TV with an HDMI socket.

If 'coding' is not a good enough reason to buy one (really?!) then remember the RPi will run a version of [LibreOffice](http://www.raspberryconnect.com/officesoftware/item/125-libreoffice-raspberry-pi) (a close relative of OpenOffice) so you can do 'ordinary' homework too :-)

And in case you hadn't noticed, the national [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) organisation is now [part of](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/putting-a-code-club-in-every-community/) the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

## Spring 2016
 * [Session 1](2016_01_11_session_1): 11/1/2016 - in which we put together the RPi and start some simple Minecraft coding
 * [Session 2](2016_01_18_session_2): 18/1/2016 - in which we do some more Minecraft coding and try to catch players in an ice cage
 * [Session 3](2016_01_25_session_3): 25/1/2016 - in which we develop some Minecraft Pi defenses and traps and discover that [all is not well with Minecraft Pi entities](MinecraftPi_entity_issues.md)
 * [Session 4](2016_02_01_session_4): 1/2/2016 - in which we try to run SonicPi but discover we need to upgrade the version (2.4 -> 2.9) that came with our Pis. Instead we revert to pythoning Minecraft Pi and continue to hit [problems with entities](MinecraftPi_entity_issues.md)
 * [Session 5](2016_02_08_session_5): 8/2/2016 - in which we try to run SonicPi (again)
