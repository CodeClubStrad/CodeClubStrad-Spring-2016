# Code Club Strad: Spring 2016
Contains all code week by week for the [Stradbroke High School](http://www.stradbrokehigh.co.uk/) Code Club during the spring term 2016. You can re-use any of the code under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

We'll be using the credit card sized Raspberry Pi computers to try:
 * Programming [Minecraft](http://pi.minecraft.net/) with [Python](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html)
 * Programming music with [SonicPi](http://sonic-pi.net/)
 * Linking them together to do SonicMinecraft :-)
 * Coding a basic [html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) web page and then enhancing it with [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

For Minecraft Pi we'll be making a lot of use of:
 * Craig Richardson's brilliant [learning python with Minecraft Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/learning-python-using-codecademy/) book;
 * some very useful [FlashCards](http://blog.whaleygeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/minecraftPi-flashcards.pdf) from [@whaleygeek](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek)
 * the excellent [Adventures in Minecraft](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/adventures-in-minecraft.html) from [@whaleygeek](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek) and [@martinohanlon](https://twitter.com/martinohanlon)
 * and we might even try [tracking Major Tim](https://damianmooney.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/raspberry-pi-minecraft-iss-tracker/) on the ISS

For SonicPi we'll be:
 * testing out some 'lessons' from [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sonic-pi-lessons/lessons/)
 * [Music Live Coding](http://www.sonicpiliveandcoding.com/)
 * using the [non-broken bits](MinecraftPi_entity_issues.md) of the minecraft API to link SonicPi to MinecraftPi

If you want to buy your own Raspberry Pi (and all sorts of other extra bits) you can try:
 * [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/)
 * [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/raspberry-pi)
 * and don't forget you will need a monitor/TV with an HDMI socket.

If 'coding' is not a good enough reason to buy one (really?!) then remember the RPi will run a version of [LibreOffice](http://www.raspberryconnect.com/officesoftware/item/125-libreoffice-raspberry-pi) (a close relative of OpenOffice) so you can do 'ordinary' homework too :-)

And in case you hadn't noticed, the national [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) organisation is now [part of](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/putting-a-code-club-in-every-community/) the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

## Week by week
 * [Session 1](2016_01_11_session_1): 11/1/2016 - in which we put together the RPi and start some simple Minecraft coding
 * [Session 2](2016_01_18_session_2): 18/1/2016 - in which we do some more Minecraft coding and try to catch players in an ice cage
 * [Session 3](2016_01_25_session_3): 25/1/2016 - in which we develop some Minecraft Pi defenses and traps and discover that [all is not well with Minecraft Pi entities](MinecraftPi_entity_issues.md)
 * [Session 4](2016_02_01_session_4): 1/2/2016 - in which we try to run SonicPi but discover we need to upgrade the version (2.4 -> 2.9) that came with our Pis. Instead we revert to pythoning Minecraft Pi and continue to hit [problems with entities](MinecraftPi_entity_issues.md)
 * [Session 5](2016_02_08_session_5): 8/2/2016 - in which we try to explore SonicPi (again)
 * [Session 6](2016_02_29_session_6): 29/2/2016 - in which we connect SonicPi to MinecraftPi
 * [Session 7](2016_02_29_session_7): 07/3/2016 
 * [Session 8](2016_03_14_session_8): 14/3/2016 - in which we use SonicPi to make musical walls and towers
 * [Session 9](2016_04_18_session_9): 18/4/2016 - in which we try to build a very basic web page and experiment with CSS
 * [Session 10](2016_04_25_session_10): 25/4/2016 - in which we attempted to write an interactive web page using javascript
